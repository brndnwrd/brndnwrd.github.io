# Synestaether - Unity Game  
![preview]({{site.url}}/demos/synestaether/preview.png#preview)  
A 3 month game design project by my 3-person student team, Sans Serif Studios, as part of CS_377 Game Design Studio at Northwestern University. Synestaether is a physics-based puzzle game where the player configures a 3d cube-based world in order to construct routes for marbles to reach their designated buckets.

# Unity Pinball Demo
![preview]({{site.url}}/demos/unity-pinball-demo/preview.png#preview)  
An assignment from my CS_376 Video Game Design & Development class. The goal was to create our own Unity project from scratch with whatever parts of the project are necessary for our design. Mechanics were created to be as simple as possible, fulfilling a few basic requirements of interactivity, as the assignment took place over less than a week.  
The project is a basic pinball game based on the broadside mechanic of the classic 1992 Black Rose pinball machine.
