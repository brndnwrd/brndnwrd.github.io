        <h4>Tech Art at Electronic Arts</h4>
        <p>At Electronic Arts I was one of three technical artists within CREATE Animation, a group of animators primarily focused on cinematics. In my biggest project at EA, I developed a repurposed customizable animation picker tool for animating monsters in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. My work also included rapidly embedding into many different teams around the company and becoming a local expert in their unique tech stacks, as well as providing bespoke tools and scripting solutions at any scale.
