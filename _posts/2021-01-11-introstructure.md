An MEL script and base scene for Maya which generates a scenic river valley of variable length and animates a boat with camera to float gently down the river. Created for my final project in RTVF 395 3d Computer Animation at Northwestern University. I will be expanding on this project in the coming months in order to present it as my capstone project for Northwestern University School of Communications' Media Arts & Game Design module. Possible routes for expansion include performance improvements, automated rendering control, additional variants for scenery, and new points of interest.

This was my first experience using MEL. The main hurdle at the start was establishing a comfortable working setup with PyMEL and using VS Code as a useful editor. Once I was set up, I found the PyMEL documentation and Maya script listener extremely useful for trying out snippets of code by hand and preparing them to be included in my main solution.
