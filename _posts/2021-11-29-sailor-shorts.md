A simple character asset; mesh created in Blender and material created in Substance Painter. These sailor shorts were textured almost entirely with careful application of masks, generators, and filters, minimal painting. Details include custom seams made with auto-stitcher, UV-border masks, and crease generators; buttonhole stitching; and a simple anchor system for masks separating the shorts, hems, and buttons into distinct sections on the same texture.
