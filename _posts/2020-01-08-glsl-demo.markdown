The final project of my CS_351-1 Intro to Graphics class, this project demos GLSL vertex and fragment shaders for representing Phong and Gouraud shading with Phong lighting in WebGL, as well as multiple materials.  
The completed project, including the original report, can be viewed on my github profile [here](https://github.com/brndnwrd/WebGL-Exploration-3)
