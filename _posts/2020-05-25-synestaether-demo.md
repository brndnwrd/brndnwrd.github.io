A 3 month game design project by my 3-person student team, Sans Serif Studios, as part of CS_377 Game Design Studio at Northwestern University. Synestaether is a physics-based puzzle game where the player configures a 3d cube-based world in order to construct routes for marbles to reach their designated buckets.  
View the readme in the zip for instructions and deeper explanations than what is portrayed in the game. I plan to return to this for more polish and more levels in a couple months.
