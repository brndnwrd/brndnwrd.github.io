An assignment from my CS_376 Video Game Design & Development class. The goal was to create our own Unity project from scratch with whatever parts of the project are necessary for our design. Mechanics were created to be as simple as possible, fulfilling a few basic requirements of interactivity, as the assignment took place over less than a week.  
The project is a basic pinball game based on the broadside mechanic of the classic 1992 Black Rose pinball machine. The ball will roll around with gravity towards the bottom of the screen. The frame will keep the ball inside. The flippers can hit the ball. If the ball touches the grey target at the top center of the screen it will be kicked back to its starting position at the top of the rail. Every time the target is hit, a point is scored. If the ball falls below the flippers, the game is over.  
The left and right flippers are controlled by the left and right arrow keys respictively. The game can be reset by pressing space.  
The completed project can be viewed on my github profile [here](https://github.com/brndnwrd/Unity-Exploration-5)
