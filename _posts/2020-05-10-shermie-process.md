A project in character art practice. This character variously includes adapted high poly assets, high poly assets with textures baked onto a lower poly form fit to the base body, and original texutres on new mesh built to fit parts of the base body.  
The dress texture was transfered from high poly to a low poly mesh made from the base body, keeping it in-line with the game style and making the skinning process simpler.  
Accessories were included as-is in high poly as they required minimal manipulation in skin and material.  
Some gaps such as underclothes were custom made fresh to fit the base body and be unobstructive to the outfit.  
3d work was done with 3ds Max, bakingin xNormal, and texture image editing/creation in Photoshop.
