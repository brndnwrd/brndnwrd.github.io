Technical Artist and Programmer  

My goal is to reduce the unnecessary time and physical exertion in the everyday processes of artists through software, enabling them to create as freely as possible. My primary tools are DCC programs such as Maya, 3ds Max, and Blender and the scripting languages used to enhance and interface with them, most prominently Python.  

I believe technical art is also a deeply social discipline, built upon a foundation of communication between users of all frames of technical familiarity. I'm always eager to talk about the ideas behind tech art, so let's get in touch!
